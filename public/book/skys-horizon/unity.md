# Attempt Nr. 2: Unity

This one didn't last very long.

I have been using the Unity engine for a long time now. In fact, it's the program I have written my very first lines of code in and I enjoyed it a lot. Well... until I didn't.

Don't get me wrong, Unity can be a great tool for game development, but it's not the right one for me. I have been trying to create more complex games with it like Sky's Horizon, but I always felt like I was constantly fighting against the engine rather than working with it.

I like the component system and the editor, but many primitive tools are missing that I need to feel comfortable to work with it.
