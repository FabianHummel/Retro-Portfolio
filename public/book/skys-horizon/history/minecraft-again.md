# Attempt Nr. 5: Minecraft, *but this time for real*

The fifth iteration again uses Minecraft as a base, but it has evolved greatly since the last time I've used it. Many features were added and abstracted in favor of mapmakers, such as data driven item components and a fairly customizable shader pipeline (altough that might change in the future). These things are essential for a good game engine and Minecraft more and more fits my needs, because it has everything that I need to fulfill my dreams.

The current state of the game is documented in the individual articles, so they won't be explained here. Have fun exploring, I really recommend the [devlogs](#/book/skys-horizon/devlogs)! :)
