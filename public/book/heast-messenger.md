# Heast Messenger

Heast is a secure, community-driven messenger service written fully in dotNet/C#. 
It's based on decentralised, optionally self-hosted servers for your friends and family to hang out together.

The idea for this project came to me and a friend of mine when we were looking on how to create online networks in Java.
We first thought of creating a multiplayer game, but then we decided to create a messenger service instead, as we didn't want to be blocked by the typical hurdles of game development.

The project is *(fully)* documented on our [GitBook](https://heast.gitbook.io/docs/).
