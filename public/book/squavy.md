Squavy is a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) written in SolidJS/Typescript and a partially native Rust backend for realtime collaboration and audio synthesis with optional VST-Plugin support all within the browser.

The idea for the project sparked when me and some friends from school thought of ideas for our diploma project in june 2022, way before the actual diploma timespan in 2025 for our school class. This has the added benefit that we could fully focus on the project's implementation before all the bureaucracy would block motivation and resources and also gave us a great head start in contrast to *"competing"* projects.
