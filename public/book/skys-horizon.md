*For over a hundred years, outer space has been under control by the AFI, a leading scientific institute filled with propaganda, manipulation and oppression. Scientist Chance and his companion Chris secretly discover a revolutionary breakthrough in space exploration that they use against the intentions of the institute. However, this discovery doesn't come at no cost - during an intense chase, Chance looses his friend while using the opportunity to leave the space station once and for all. But the situation keeps escalating... A mysterious forcefield causes Chance to crash on planet Sorax 4B, where he is confronted with entirely new challenges including fighting, exploring and seeking friendship with the unknown.*

Sky's Horizon is all about exploration and survival whilst accompanied by a story that is being told through the protagonist Chance, who is played by you. I try to keep a good ratio between freedom and story driven design, where the player is pointed into the right direction to progress further, but isn't forced to play along at all times.

This project is one of my few dream games of my life, and has been hunting me since the last few years. It has been through so many iterations using different game engines and concepts, but none of them seemed to be the right one. The history can be viewed [here](#/book/skys-horizon/history/minecraft.md).
