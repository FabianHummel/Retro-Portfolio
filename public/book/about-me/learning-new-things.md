# My approach to learning new things

During the last few years I have created several projects and tried something new with each of them. When learning a new language for example, I always try to build something small around it to train practical use right from the start.

When I get to create the project, I often already have a rough idea what of what I want it to be about. It's then only up to planning and writing the code. If my motivation is high enough, I will finish the project, but if not, I will just leave it as it is and move on to the next project - even though I am not proud of that.
