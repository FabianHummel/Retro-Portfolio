# Software Development

I think maintaing a clean, structured and consistent codebase is the key for efficient and fun software development. I also see a clear relation between my way of writing code and my day-to-day habits of keeping a clean room or workplace and staying organized with my real-life tasks. The codebase is the place I essentially live and work in. If it's not tidy I get upset really fast.

Often, I rather tend to rewrite an entire piece of software than slowly cleaning it up for it to meet my quality standards, but I don't see this as as much of an issue, because it gives me the opportunity to learn from prior mistakes. Rewriting also sounds like much work, but many people forget that the logic is already there, just not in a shape that it's supposed to be.

This mindset really reflects on virtually all of my major projects, namely [Squavy](#/book/squavy.md), [Amethyst](#/book/amethyst.md), [Heast Messenger](#/book/heast-messenger.md) and [Sky's Horizon](#/book/skys-horizon.md), which all have suffered from at least one overhaul - *for the good*.
