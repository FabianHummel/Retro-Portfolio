# How I got to (Web)-Design

It all started with my first few WMC (web & mobile computing) classes in first grade of highschool. According to my teacher, we are only supposed to learn HTML and some CSS layout properties so we could make proper functional websites...

But I was never happy with handing over \"unfinished looking\" websites for my assignments. It was that moment when I started looking at webdesigners' portfolios and ideas. I read through modern UI pricinciples and how to make well structured, good looking user interfaces. This helped me a lot in understanding how the design affects the user experience and that it's important to make the consumer feel comfortable with the product.
