If we remind ourselves of the design chapter from before, you might remember that I learned a lot about UI design. Well, making user interfaces isn't the only thing I started doing. Experimenting with illustrations and logos is also something I enjoy doing ever since.

So I started making my own avatars. And boy, did I make a lot of them. They got simpler and simpler over time, but not in a bad way. The latest version of it is the one you see on the top of this page.

Dragons. Those majestic creatures have always been my favorite. I love their shape, I can let my creativity run wild with them. My latest one is actually based on the logo from LLVM, the compiler framework for the C family and other languages.
