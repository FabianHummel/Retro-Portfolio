# About my portfolio

I am talking about the website you are currently on, obviously. This isn't my first portfolio, but it's the first one I'm actually kinda proud of. I tried a lot of different ideas and layouts, but none of them felt right. Sometimes I would get stuck on a single page for days, trying to make it look good or having to deal with the struggles of making it responsive.

Eventually, I decided to go with a simple, minimalistic design based on my (not anywhere near finished) game. As you can see, i went with a black-and-white theme that absolutely destroys your eyes if you look at it for too long - I'm sorry...

For the nerds out there: I made this website using Solid.JS and TailwindCSS. Yes, I refuse to use React! The full source code is available on my GitHub page.
