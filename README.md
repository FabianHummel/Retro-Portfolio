- üéµ Music Creation

The portfolio features an interactive music player, which you can use to directly listen to the music I created. The system is done with a combination of the **[Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API)** and **[SolidJS Components](https://www.solidjs.com/docs/latest/api)**.

This is the link to the live version of this portfolio hosted on an easyname webserver. (I do also plan to add a real domain name to this website in the future.)
